I would like to have a backend project with python FastAPI.
In this project there will be only one endpoint, which will received `StudySubject` as parameter (the sturctur is provided below).

```json
{
    "Content": ""
}
```

Then bakend will apply this **Content** on a specific Chat Template, and Send request to OpenAI.
